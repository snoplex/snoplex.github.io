        <div class="p fixed">It was interesting to know that even after destroying her brain cells; the disease could not take away the basic courtesies from her, acquired during her training as a Telephone Operator long long ago. They remained entrenched in her till her
            last breath. She never forgot to express her sincere thanks whenever we help her with little things.</div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="p fixed">The thud sound of a body hitting the ground rudely awakened us. We looked around to find my mother missing from her bed. In a swift motion my wife jumped from the bed and dashed out of the room to find her lay flat, face down on the floor motion
            less. Her fore head was badly injured. She was bleeding profusely from her lips due to the impact of the fall. But there was virtually no reaction from her. We physically lifted her and put her on the bed. My wife gently cleansed the wound
            and enquired whether it was hurting. She replied in affirmative. But there was no sign of pain in the face. No tears in her eyes. Just plain disoriented look, devoid of any feelings and emotions. The disease took away all her emotional feelings
            and also dried up the tear glands. Looking at her state I cried silently.</div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="p fixed">Oh God! I said to myself. Is this is my mother, who used to get tears in her eyes even for a faint discomfort? She was emotionally so sensitive that even a stern look, would bring her to tears. Such was her reputation for crying that my father
            used to tease her by calling her “Gangadhari”. Lady wearing river Ganges on her head.</div>
